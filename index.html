                        TED-'Ideas worth spreading' at the Cochin University of Science and Technology campus. This
                        season will give a platform to people from all walks of life who help inspire and catalyse our
                        lives into powerful and better versions of ourselves. For some, this event will mean life as
                        they have yet to experience it and for others, it will mean transcending boundaries. We believe
                        that genius ideas are generated when different people come together under one roof and these
                        ideas have the potential to change attitudes, society and ultimately the world. Such stories of
                        endeavour and experience will urge you to doubt reasons, redefine your definitions and play a
                        part in progressing forward for the greater good. All set to ignite some sweet rebellions and
                        ask many big questions, the first ever event of its kind here will create conversations that
                        matter and spread ideas worth spreading. Are you ready to be radically open about the stuff of
                        life? We are!

                        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that
                        bring people together to share a TED-like experience.
                        At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and
                        connection.
                        These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED
                        event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx
                        events are self-organized.</p>

                        The archetypal, clichéd world of today has become a garden of remembrance for many a fallen
                        martyr overwhelmed by the enduring idea of perfectionism. The strong alliance to the sense of
                        being perfect has been so deeply incorporated into civilization, that striking equilibrium is
                        now considered old-school. Quitting this dangerously inherent cult of being a ‘Quintessential
                        example’ of everything is a radical change that our present society is in desperate need of. The
                        truth is, we are all human, we err and we are all flawed, but we cannot, and should not deplore
                        over every flaw. Our line of thoughts, here at CUSAT are not aligned with considering that
                        striving for perfection is generic. We do not advocate mediocrity but believe strongly in
                        setting soaring goals for what we love and passionately following them. By doing this we can
                        always make sure to have something to work towards since there always is room for improvement.
                        At the same time, it is just as important to learn to be less harsh on ourselves in the face of
                        failure when we fall short of the unrealistic ideal, we have in mind. We have to relearn how to
                        be kind to ourselves, to grow- it is not always easy, often it takes some gruelingly hard work,
                        immense amounts of effort, and tremendous courage to get outside our comfort zone and grow—but
                        growth is a critical part of life. If we’re not growing, we’re dying. We believe in celebrating
                        how "imperfectly perfect" life is, doing away with the age-old passé definition of perfect and
                        inculcating this notion into our everyday lives. Because we are but human and as someone clearly
                        remarked-"Screw Perfect"!</p>
